To do:
Have initial graphing with initial send and initial receive; then start loop
Connect server code with graphing code
Connect client code with picture-taking code
  Make sure port open for entire time; no need to open and close
  Open, picture-taking + sending on loop, receiving + regraphing on loop => close on keyboard interrupt? button press?
